				<h2>Canadian healthcare provider issues data breach warning after server hack</h2>
				<p>Canadian healthcare service provider Scarborough Health Network (SHN) has warned that a data breach may have exposed patient healthcare records.

					In a breach notice, SHN explained that its IT staff noticed unusual activity on its systems on January 25.
					
					After containing the problem and calling in help from external IT forensics experts, a subsequent investigation discovered that a “subset of data” on a number of SHN’s servers had been accessed by unauthorized parties.
					
					Unnamed hackers were kicked off its systems by February 1, according to SHN. IT security controls and monitoring practices have been upgraded to guard against potential follow-up attacks.</p>

				<h2>Tails users warned not to launch bundled Tor Browser until security fix is released</h2>
				<p>Tails is warning users to stop using Tor Browser that comes bundled with the privacy-focused operating system (OS), after the discovery of a prototype pollution vulnerability.

					Tor Browser is a modification of the open source Firefox web browser, which is where the critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-1802, was found.
					
					The bug could enable an attacker to corrupt the methods of an Array object in JavaScript via prototype pollution, potentially achieving the execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript code in a privileged context.
					
					A second bug, tracked as CVE-2022-1529, could allow an attacker to send a message to the parent process where the contents could be used to double-index into a JavaScript object, leading to prototype pollution and ultimately allowing attacker-controlled JavaScript executing in the privileged parent process.</p>
